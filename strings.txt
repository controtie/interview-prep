Strings:
Unicode vs ASCII
- Validate what kind of strings are used as inputs from interviewer
- Usually this is Unicode or ASCII

ASCII:
- ASCII is more primitive, it defines 128 characters, with numbers from 0 - 128
- For example, the ASCII number 65 is defined as the capital letter 'A'
- Why 128 characters? (a byte should allow for 256 combinations)
  - We only use 7 bits for characters. The last bit is called the parity bit.
  - The parity bit is used for error checking

Unicode:
- Unicode is a superset of ASCII
- The first 128 numbers have the same meaning as they do in ASCII
- Unicode supports many more characters, up to just under 2^21
- Since Unicode characters don't always fit into 8-bit bytes, there are multiple encodings
- e.g. UTF-8 and UTF-32

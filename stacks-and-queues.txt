Stacks & Queues:

Stacks:
- A stack stores data in last-in, first-out scheme (like a stack of dinner plates)
- Commonly implemented methods: push(), pop(), peek(), isEmpty()
- Commonly used: implementing recursive algorithms iteratively, stack-based machine languages

Queue:
- A queue stores data in first-in, first-out scheme (like a line at a cash register)
- Commonly implemented methods: add(), remove(), peek(), isEmpty()
- Commonly used: breadth first search. Populate queue with next set of nodes to search for
